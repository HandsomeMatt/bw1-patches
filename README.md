## Synopsis

A collection of binary patches for Black & White 1 and it's expansion pack Creature Isle.
By default the game comes packed using SECUROM, I won't go into extracting it here, the
patches are for the unprotected binary file.

If you are looking for these patches precompiled into the binary you can look on [BWFiles](http://bwfiles.com) for the unofficial fan patch I have compiled which includes all the patches below. This repository acts just to version track those changes.

## Abandonware

Black & White (2001) can be assumed under the rules of abandonware; the original developers Lionhead Studios Ltd. are no longer in business and the publisher EA Games no longer distribute the game itself or required patches for the game as well as offer no support for the game itself that no longer runs on modern operating systems.
